Features
Low Latency: With Go's native support for concurrency and parallelism, this booking system ensures ultra-low latency. Users can book, modify, or cancel reservations with minimal wait times.

Real-time Performance: Real-time processing is a cornerstone of the Golang Booking System. Real-time reservations, availability checks, and updates happen seamlessly and efficiently.

Resource Optimization: Go's design and concurrency support help optimize resource utilization. The system can serve a large number of simultaneous users without compromising performance.

Scalability: The project is built with scalability in mind. It can handle a growing number of users and reservations effortlessly.

Cost-Efficiency: By minimizing resource usage and maximizing performance, the system is cost-effective and suitable for a wide range of applications.

Technologies
Golang: The core language used to build this booking system, Golang, is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and robust standard library.

Gin-Gonic: The Gin web framework for Golang is employed for routing, middleware, and creating APIs.

Redis: Redis is used for caching and quick retrieval of frequently requested data, contributing to low latency.

Docker: Docker containers are utilized for easy deployment and management of the system.

Docker Compose: To coordinate multi-container Docker applications, Docker Compose simplifies the process.

## Getting Started
### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:


`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golang-booking-system.git`
## Usage
Install Docker and Docker Compose if you haven't already.

Build the Docker containers:


`docker-compose build`


Start the system:

`docker-compose up`

Open your browser and access the booking system at http://localhost:8080.


## How It Works
The Golang Booking System utilizes the power of Go for handling bookings and reservations efficiently. When a user makes a booking request, the system uses goroutines to process the request concurrently, minimizing wait times. Redis caching ensures quick access to frequently requested data.
